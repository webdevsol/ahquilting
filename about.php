past, through our lives, and into the future.&nbsp;
This diamond design deserves to be recreated as an exercise&nbsp;in learning
to quilt, but it also can be carried into our time with infinite variations.</p>
<h2>The Lancaster Diamond Sampler Quilt</h2>
<p>This colorful quilt is one of a
small group of similar quilts made in the mid-1800s in Lancaster County,
Pennsylvania.&nbsp;&nbsp; The most famous quilt in
this group is the Fanny S. Bucher (1841-1910) quilt, an icon of Lancaster
County quilting arts.&nbsp; The Lancaster
Diamond Sampler Quilt was made by "Anonymous"&nbsp;and is obviously the sister to
the Fanny S. Bucher quilt. The unusual feature of these quilts is that the
diamond-shaped blocks are not the typical 45 degree diamond (Lone Star) or the
60 degree diamond (Tumbling Blocks) shapes that we usually find.</p>
<p>Although
the two quilts share block designs and fabric, each of the 173 blocks in each
quilt is a different design.&nbsp; The
double-pink sashing and poison-green cornerstones frame each block and separate
them into individual quilt block gems.&nbsp;
Frequent use of Turkey Red and Chrome Yellow complete the "Dutchy"&nbsp;color
scheme of these quilts.</p>
<h2>Diamond Variations</h2>
<p>The diamond
design can be used to make a variety of quilts that can incorporate scraps, old
blocks, orphan blocks, unused quilt tops, and plain fabric.&nbsp; The diamonds may be put together with or
without sashing.</p><p>
An acrylic template for cutting the blocks,
sashing, and cornerstones is available.</p>
