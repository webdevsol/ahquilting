Some people want to re-create the original quilt.  There are 173 different, diamond-shaped blocks in this breathtaking quilt.  Working on these blocks is like opening a new box of chocolates - each one is tasty in a different way.  There is weird and wonderful applique.  There is curved piecing.  There are miniatures for the fussiest miniaturist.  There is a range of patchwork from simple to insanely intricate.<br><br>
Some people like the diamond block shape and want to use it with plain fabric.  Some people use the template to cut up old blocks or boring tops to recycle them into beautiful scrap quilts.  Look at the photo album to see some examples.<br><br>
<p><strong>Note from Ann</strong>: I decided to distribute project sheets as pdf files so that you can download different design variations that use the Lancaster Diamond.  All I ask is that you don't re-sell my drawings or project sheets for a profit.  I encourage you to share these designs with other quilters and, particularly, to share your skills with new quilters.  Let's keep quilting alive!</p><br>
